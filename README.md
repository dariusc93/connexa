## Description

Based and inspired by [rust-ipfs](https://github.com/dariusc93/rust-ipfs), Connexa is built on top of `rust-libp2p`. It
provides a high-level abstraction to simplify running and managing libp2p protocols.

The goal of Connexa is to make it easier to leverage `rust-libp2p` and its built-in protocols, while also allowing
developers to build and integrate their own custom protocols.

## Project Status
